	<h2><b>How the Web Works:</b></h2>
	<p>Your browser makes requests via the Internet to servers. These requests are using a protocol called <em>HTTP</em>. And the servers respond with files that the browser displays.
Some examples of browsers include Chrome, Safari, Firefox, Internet Explorer, and Edge. You're probably running one of those right this moment.
These servers are computers just like yours except they are optimized for sitting in a closet and hosting files rather than sitting on your desk browsing these files. And the protocol HTTP is just a very simple protocol that your browser uses to communicate with these servers. We'll mostly be focusing on the browser component in this section for rendering HTML files.

	<h2>HTML</h2>
	<p>HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>t</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage, and it is the most widely used language to write Web Pages.</p>
	<ul style="list-style-type:disc">
		<li><b>Hypertext</b> refers to the way in which Web pages (HTML documents) are linked together. Thus, the link available on a webpage is called Hypertext.</li>
		<li>As its name suggests, HTML is a Markup Language which means you use HTML to simply "mark-up" a text document with tags that tell a Web browser how to structure it to display.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48724340">This video</a> gives a good review</p>
	
	<h2>Tags and Elements</h2>
	<p>HTML documents are made up of HTML elements. When writing HTML, we tell browsers the type of each element by using HTML tags. An HTML element is defined by a starting tag. If the element contains other content, it ends with a closing tag, where the element name is preceded by a forward slash.
		<a href="https://www.udacity.com/course/viewer#!/c-nd000/l-3873828673/m-48723444">This video</a> explains the distinction well</p>
	
	<h2>Attributes</h2>
	<ul style="list-style-type:square">
		<li>All HTML elements can have attributes</li>
		<li>Attributes provide additional information about an element</li>
		<li>Attributes are always specified in the start tag</li>
		<li>Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value"</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h2>Why Computers are Stupid</h2>
	<p>Computers are stupid because they interpret instructions literally. This makes them very unforgiving since a small mistake by a programmer can cause huge problems in a program.</p>
	
	<h2>Inline vs Block Elements</h2>
	<p>An inline element does not start on a new line and only takes up as much width as necessary. Some of the inline elements are &lt;b&gt;, &lt;em&gt;, &lt;img&gt;, &lt;span&gt; etc.</p>
	<p>A block-level element always starts on a new line and takes up the full width available (stretches out to the left and right as far as it can). Example of block elements are &lt;div&gt;, &lt;p&gt;, &lt;form&gt; etc.</p>
	
	<h2>Div</h2>
	<p>This is often used as a container for other HTML elements.This has no required attributes, but both style and class are common.When used together with CSS, this element can be used to style blocks of content:</p>
	
	<h2>Span</h2>
	<p>This element is often used as a container for some text. It has no required attributes, but both style and class are common. When used together with CSS, this element can be used to style parts of the text:</p>
